# WPF Demo App, based on Microsoft 's 2010 FolderExplorer VB.Net sample. 
I'm rewriting it with .Net 8.0 c# WPF

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/bb546972(v=vs.100)

I put example file Folder.vb in this repo for reference. I translated it to C# as Folder.cs
Initially I used Microsoft Copilot (on 11/6/2025) to translate it, but translation was not perfect. 
Copilot don't know how to translate "If ... End If" to C# when ther are several statements in between.
